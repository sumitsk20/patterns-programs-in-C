****** HINT FILE FOR n10 ******

> Divide the pattern in two major part upper & lower.
> Further divide each of two part in LEFT & RIGHT for ' ' & digits.
> Initialize a counter

## FOR UPPER TRIANGLE (while counter < = count of row)
> Run an outer loop for the count of row from n to 1.
> Run two inner loop,1st for printing ' ' and 2nd for printing Count.
> Use if else.
> Increment counter
 (look code for better understanding)

## FOR LOWER TRIANGLE
> Run an outer loop for the count of row from n to 1.
> Run two inner loop,1st for printing ' ' and 2nd for printing Count.
> Use if else.
> Decrement Counter.
