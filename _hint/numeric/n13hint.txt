****** HINT FILE FOR n13 ******

> Divide the pattern in two part LEFT & RIGHT.
> Run an outer loop for the count of row from 1 to n.
> Initialize a couner c to 1 & another counter k to n.

## FOR LEFT TRIANGLE

> Run an inner loop for space from k to count of row.
> Print space.
> Decrement Counter.

## FOR RIGHT TRIANGLE

> Run an inner loop from 1 to count of row.
> Print counter c.
> Intialize c to a valid expression.
