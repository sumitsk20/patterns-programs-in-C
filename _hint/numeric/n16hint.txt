> Divide the pattern in two part UPPER & LOWER.
> Run an outer loop for the count of row from 1 to n.

## FOR UPPER PART

> Run an inner loop for column from 1 to count of row.
> Use if else to print digit with '*' & digit without '*'.

## FOR LOWER PART

> Run an inner loop for column from n to 1.
> Use if else to print digit with '*' & digit without '*'.
