## TRY TO FIGURE OUT COMBINATION OF ROW & COLUMN.

> Run an outer loop for the count of row from 1 to n.
> Run an internal loop for count of column from 1 to count of row.
> Print count of row * count of column.(look code for better understanding) 

NOTE: You can also try other approach than this.
