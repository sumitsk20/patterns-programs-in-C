> Divide the pattern in two part upper & lower.

## FOR UPPER TRIANGLE
> Run an outer loop for the count of row.
> Run two inner loop,1st for printing ' ' and 2nd for printing Digits.

## FOR LOWER TRIANGLE
> Run an outer loop for the count of row from n-1 to 1.
> Run two inner loop,1st for printing ' ' and 2nd for printing Digits.
