> Divide the pattern in two part upper & lower.

## FOR UPPER TRIANGLE
> Run an outer loop for the count of row.
> Run an inner loop for the count of column.
> Figure out combination of row & column where * is to be printed. (look code for better understanding)
> Use if-else condition. 

## FOR LOWER TRIANGLE
> Run an outer loop for the count of row starting from n+1, where n is count of row in upper triangle.
> Run an inner loop for the count of column.
> Figure out combination of row & column where * is to be printed. (look code for better understanding)
> Use if-else condition.
