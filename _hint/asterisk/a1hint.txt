> Divide the pattern in two part i.e upper part(numeric) & lower part(asterisk).
> Run an outer loop for the count of row.
> Run two internal loops seperately for numeric & asterisk part.
> Loop for numeric will run from number of row to the count of row. 
> Loop for asterisk will start when count of row is 2. 

NOTE: You can also try other approach than this.
