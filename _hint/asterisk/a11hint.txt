> Divide the pattern in two part LEFT & RIGHT.
> Run an outer loop for the count of row.

>>TWO INNER LOOPS<<

## FOR LEFT TRIANGLE
> Run an inner loop from 1 to n for count of column.
> use if-else condition for printing '*' & ' '.
 (look code for better understanding)

## FOR RIGHT TRIANGLE
> Run an inner loop from n-1 to 1 for count of column.
> use if-else condition for printing '*' & ' '.
