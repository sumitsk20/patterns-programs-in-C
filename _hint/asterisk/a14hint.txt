>> LOOK THE PATTERN AS MULTIPLE CROSS PRINTED REPEATEDLY <<

## FOR PRINTING SINGLE CROSS

> Run an outer loop for the count of row.
> Run an inner loop for the count of column.
> Figure out combination of row & column where * is to be printed. (look code for better understanding)
> Use if-else condition to print '*' and ' ' at right combination of row and colum. 

## REPEAT THE CROSS USING WHILE LOOP n Times.( Consider n as number of nodes in DNA.)

NOTE: You can also try other approach than this.
